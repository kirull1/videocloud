# Entities Layer

This directory contains business entities with their data and logic.

In the Feature-Sliced Design methodology, entities are the building blocks of your business domain. They represent core business concepts and contain:

- Data models
- Business logic related to a specific entity
- API methods for working with the entity

Entities should be independent of specific UI implementations or user interactions.
