# Features Layer

This directory contains user interactions and actions that change the application state.

In the Feature-Sliced Design methodology, features represent:

- User interactions (forms, buttons, etc.)
- Business processes
- Actions that change the state of entities

Features can use entities but should not depend on other features or pages. They implement specific user scenarios and business logic.
