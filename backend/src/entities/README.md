# Entities Directory

This directory contains TypeORM entity classes that represent database tables.

In NestJS with TypeORM, entities are classes that map to database tables. Each entity:

- Defines the structure of a database table
- Contains properties that map to table columns
- Includes relationships to other entities
- May contain entity-specific methods

Entities are used by repositories to interact with the database and are the foundation of the data layer in the application.
