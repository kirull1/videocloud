# Modules Directory

This directory contains feature modules for the NestJS application.

In NestJS, modules are used to organize the application structure. Each module encapsulates a specific feature or domain of the application, such as:

- Authentication
- User management
- Video processing
- Comments and interactions

Each module typically contains:
- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests
- Services: Implement business logic
- DTOs: Define data transfer objects
- Entities: Define database models
- Repositories: Handle database operations

Modules help maintain a clean separation of concerns and make the codebase more maintainable.
