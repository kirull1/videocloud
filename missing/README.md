The development server will start on port 5173 by default. Visit http://localhost:5173 to see the 404 page.

## Integration with VideoCloud

The static files generated by this project can be deployed to any static file hosting service or CDN. They can be used as custom error pages in web servers like Nginx or Apache, or in cloud hosting platforms.

Example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    # ... other configuration ...
    
    error_page 404 /404.html;
    location = /404.html {
        root /path/to/dist;
        internal;
    }
}
```
