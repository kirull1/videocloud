# VideoCloud Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The VideoCloud project is currently in the initial development phase, focusing on establishing the core architecture and foundational components. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Authentication System Implementation**
   - User registration and login flows
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Database schema and migrations
   - Avatar generation system
   - Custom avatar upload functionality

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Authentication UI components
   - User profile management
   - Avatar system implementation
   - Responsive design implementation

## Recent Changes

### Avatar System Improvements
- Created a new `/api/users/:id/avatar` endpoint in the backend to serve user avatars
- Implemented the `getUserAvatar` method in the UsersService that:
  - Returns the user's actual avatar if available
  - Generates a default avatar using DiceBear API based on username if no avatar exists
- Updated the frontend to use the new endpoint for all user avatars
- Removed dependency on the `userAvatarUrl` field in the frontend
- Ensured consistent avatar display across the application

### Avatar Upload Fix
- Fixed issue with avatar uploads where empty files (0 bytes) were being sent to S3
- Updated the FileInterceptor configuration to use memory storage instead of disk storage
- Added more detailed logging for file uploads
- Added validation to ensure the buffer exists and is not empty
- Updated the frontend code to correctly handle file uploads
- Created test scripts to verify avatar upload functionality

### User Profile Management
- Implemented user profile management backend with RESTful endpoints
- Created user controller and service with proper validation
- Added custom avatar upload functionality

- Improved error handling with descriptive messages
- Added animations for menu transitions and notifications
- Enhanced form validation and feedback
- Updated Auth component to use the user store

### Testing

- Created test scripts for direct API testing of avatar uploads

### Previous Changes
- Added `isEmailVerified` column to users table

- Added avatar generation system using DiceBear API

## Next Steps

1. **Video Management**
   - Implement video upload functionality
   - Create video processing pipeline
   - Develop video player component
   - Add video metadata management

2. **Content Organization**
   - Implement video categories and tags
   - Create playlists functionality
   - Develop user channel pages
   - Add content discovery features

3. **Additional Testing**
   - Add performance testing
   - Implement integration tests for video features
   - Create visual regression tests for UI components
   - Add accessibility testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication System
- Using JWT for stateless authentication
- Implementing secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Using TypeORM for database operations
- Implementing proper error handling and validation

### Avatar System
- Using DiceBear API for generated avatars
- Supporting custom avatar uploads with S3 storage
- Implementing fallback mechanism
- Ensuring consistent avatar generation
- Using memory storage for file uploads instead of disk storage

### Frontend Architecture
- Using Vue 3 with Composition API
- Implementing responsive design
- Using CSS modules for styling
- Following component-based architecture

## Current Blockers

1. **Video Processing**
   - Need to implement video transcoding service
   - Need to set up storage infrastructure for videos
   - Need to implement adaptive streaming

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to optimize large file uploads
   - Need to implement caching strategy
   - Need to add CDN integration for video delivery

## Team Focus

| Team Member   | Current Focus                 | Next Task                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend Team | User profile management       | Video upload and player UI    |
| Backend Team  | Profile and avatar system     | Video processing service      |
| DevOps        | Database and storage setup    | CDN and streaming setup       |
| Product       | User experience refinement    | Video features prioritization |

## Notes
- User profile management system is now fully implemented with proper validation and error handling
- Custom avatar upload functionality is now fixed and working correctly
- Frontend has been enhanced with animations, better loading states, and improved error handling
- Unit and E2E tests have been added for authentication and profile features
- Next focus should be on video management features
- Need to implement proper security measures for video content
- Need to set up infrastructure for video storage and delivery
