## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication System
- Using JWT for stateless authentication
- Implementing secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Using TypeORM for database operations
- Implementing proper error handling and validation

### Avatar System
- Using DiceBear API for generated avatars
- Supporting custom avatar uploads
- Implementing fallback mechanism
- Ensuring consistent avatar generation

### Frontend Architecture
- Using Vue 3 with Composition API
- Implementing responsive design
- Using CSS modules for styling
- Following component-based architecture

## Current Blockers

1. **Video Processing**
   - Need to implement video transcoding service
   - Need to set up storage infrastructure for videos
   - Need to implement adaptive streaming

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to optimize large file uploads
   - Need to implement caching strategy
   - Need to add CDN integration for video delivery

## Team Focus

| Team Member   | Current Focus                 | Next Task                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend Team | User profile management       | Video upload and player UI    |
| Backend Team  | Profile and avatar system     | Video processing service      |
| DevOps        | Database and storage setup    | CDN and streaming setup       |
| Product       | User experience refinement    | Video features prioritization |

## Notes
