# VideoCloud Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The VideoCloud project is currently in the initial development phase, focusing on establishing the core architecture and foundational components. The primary focus areas are:

1. **Authentication System Implementation**
   - User registration and login flows
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Database schema and migrations
   - Avatar generation system

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Authentication UI components
   - User profile management
   - Avatar system implementation
   - Responsive design implementation

## Recent Changes

### Database Migrations
- Added `isEmailVerified` column to users table
- Added `avatarUrl` column to users table
- Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamp columns to users table
- Implemented proper database initialization scripts

### Authentication System
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Created user registration and login endpoints
- Added password hashing with bcrypt
- Set up JWT strategy and guards
- Implemented user validation and error handling

### Frontend Features
- Created Auth component with responsive design
- Implemented user menu with dropdown
- Added avatar generation system using DiceBear API
- Created utility function for consistent avatar generation
- Added support for different avatar sizes
- Implemented proper state management for authentication

### Avatar System
- Implemented avatar generation using DiceBear API
- Created utility function for consistent avatar generation
- Added support for different avatar sizes
- Integrated with authentication component
- Implemented fallback to generated avatars when custom avatar is not set

## Next Steps

1. **User Profile Management**
   - Implement custom avatar upload functionality
   - Add profile editing capabilities
   - Create password change functionality
   - Add email verification system

2. **Frontend Improvements**
   - Implement proper state management for user data
   - Add loading states for authentication actions
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Add animations for menu transitions

3. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Add unit tests for avatar generation
   - Implement E2E tests for authentication flow
   - Update API documentation
   - Add component documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Authentication System
- Using JWT for stateless authentication
- Implementing secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Using TypeORM for database operations
- Implementing proper error handling and validation

### Avatar System
- Using DiceBear API for generated avatars
- Supporting custom avatar uploads
- Implementing fallback mechanism
- Ensuring consistent avatar generation

### Frontend Architecture
- Using Vue 3 with Composition API
- Implementing responsive design
- Using CSS modules for styling
- Following component-based architecture

## Current Blockers

1. **State Management**
   - Need to implement proper user state management
   - Need to handle token refresh mechanism
   - Need to implement proper error handling

2. **Testing**
   - Need to add comprehensive tests for authentication
   - Need to implement E2E tests
   - Need to add performance testing

## Team Focus

| Team Member   | Current Focus                 | Next Task                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend Team | Authentication UI            | User profile management       |
| Backend Team  | Authentication system        | Email verification system     |
| DevOps        | Database setup               | CI/CD pipeline configuration  |
| Product       | User experience refinement   | Feature prioritization        |

## Notes
- Authentication system is now implemented with proper validation and error handling
- Avatar generation system is in place with fallback mechanism
- Next focus should be on user profile management and email verification
- Need to implement proper testing for all new features
- Need to add proper documentation for all new features
- Need to implement proper security measures for all new features
- Need to add proper logging system for all new features
