# VideoCloud Memory Bank

The Memory Bank is the comprehensive documentation repository for the VideoCloud project. It serves as the single source of truth for project knowledge, ensuring that all team members have access to the same information and context.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank exists to:

1. **Maintain Project Context**: Preserve knowledge about the project's goals, architecture, and progress
2. **Document Decisions**: Record key decisions and their rationales
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor what has been completed and what remains to be done
4. **Facilitate Onboarding**: Help new team members quickly understand the project
5. **Guide Development**: Provide clear direction for implementation

## Structure

The Memory Bank is organized into the following core files:

1. **projectbrief.md**
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. **productContext.md**
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. **activeContext.md**
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. **systemPatterns.md**
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. **techContext.md**
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. **progress.md**
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

7. **.clinerules**
   - Project-specific patterns and conventions
   - Workflow guidelines
   - Common challenges and solutions
   - Implementation paths

## Usage

The Memory Bank should be:

1. **Read at the start of each work session** to refresh context
2. **Updated after significant changes** to maintain accuracy
3. **Referenced during planning** to ensure alignment with project goals
4. **Consulted when making decisions** to maintain consistency

## Maintenance

The Memory Bank is a living documentation system that evolves with the project. It should be updated:

1. When discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When context needs clarification
4. When planning new features or components

## Relationship to Code

While the Memory Bank documents the project, the code itself is the ultimate source of truth for implementation details. The Memory Bank provides context, rationale, and high-level understanding, while the code shows the actual implementation.
